  "While most of the extremely powerful supercars have special motors with 12 pistons, the Regera only has a V8, and even more suprisingly, only a single gear. Despite this, it is still one of Koenigsegg's most powerful models.",
  "The name comes from the unique achievement of the worlds first car with a 1:1 weight to power ratio. The exact amount is 1,360 kg weight to 1,360 bhp of power.",
  "The Jesko is currently Koenigsegg's fastest model. The design is made for ulitmate track performance while still being street legal. There is an option to remove the paint job and replace it with a carbon fiber coating that drops the price down about 2 and a half million dollars."
