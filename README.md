## Program Design Concept
An idea of what we want the program to look like, created in draw.io.

What the user will see the moment the app is ran. We are planning to add 2 other car brands to this list.

![ProgramConcept](https://github.com/CG-SKYLN/Program.Project/blob/gh-pages/images/ConceptStarting.png)

One brand dropdown menu is opened, revealing three car models made by that brand. The last dropdown has some extra cars with their respective brand names.

![ConceptDropdown1](https://github.com/CG-SKYLN/Program.Project/blob/gh-pages/images/ConceptDropdown1.png)

The car dropdown reveals an image of the car, followed with the model year and price, and then some statistics. At the very bottom is a small fact that is unique to the model.
