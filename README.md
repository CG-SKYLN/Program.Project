## Program Progress
An idea of what we wanted the program to look like, created in draw.io, compared to the finished app.

### This is what the user will see the moment the app is run. We added 2 other car brands to the app.

### One brand dropdown menu is opened, revealing three car models made by that brand. The "Other" option has some extra cars with their respective brand names.

### The car dropdown reveals an image of the car, followed with the model year and price, and then some statistics. At the very bottom is a small fact that is unique to the model. Some cars have different styles that the user can check out.
